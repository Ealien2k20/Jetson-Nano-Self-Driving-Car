# Jetson-Nano-Self-Driving-Car
This is a project which uses deep Convolutional Neural Networks to steer a self driving car. It is powered by Jetson Nano and Arduino UNO.

Neural networks are universal function approximators which can be used for different kinds of problems(Classification, Regression, Segmentation, etc). In this self driving car prototype, I have used regression(I have tried classification too but regression is the way to go) to predict the steering angle of a car by using the video feed of the path as input to the neural network. Use this GitHub Repo to help build your own Self Driving Car. You can also alter the code slightly to use a car with Ackerman Steering and Servo Motors instead of using the classic Line Follower styled Chassis. With that being said, lets get started.
